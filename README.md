# Pydress

For this project I chose to use FastAPI and Vue.js
In this project a user can:
  - create a contact
  - edit a contact
    - can edit name, emails, phone numbers, and addresses seperatly
  - see all contacts on home page
  - can see one contact
  - can delete a contact
  - can delete emails, phone numbers, and addresses seperatly

I did integrate USPS web API to verify addresses. A user would need to verify the address before the address can be added.

My first project using Python/FastAPI and Vue.js
